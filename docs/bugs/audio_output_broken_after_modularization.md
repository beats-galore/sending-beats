## Audio Output Broken After Modularization Refactor

**Status**: UNRESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-30

**Description**: Audio output functionality appears to be broken following a previous modularization refactor. Users are unable to hear audio output through the mixer system, indicating a critical audio pipeline break.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Start the application
2. Initialize the virtual mixer 
3. Add audio input sources (microphone, system audio, etc.)
4. Attempt to hear audio output through speakers/headphones
5. Expected: Audio should be audible through selected output device
6. Actual: No audio output is heard despite input levels showing activity

**Investigation Done**:

- Issue appears related to a previous modularization refactor that reorganized audio system components
- Timing synchronization system is working (logs show audio processing callbacks)
- VU meters likely show activity indicating audio processing is occurring
- Problem appears to be in the final audio output stage

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:

The modularization refactor likely broke one or more of:
- Audio output device routing/connection
- Final audio stream output pipeline  
- Audio output thread/callback registration
- Master output gain/mixing stage
- Output device selection/initialization

**Files to Investigate**:

- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/stream_operations.rs` - Audio output stream management
- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/mixer_core.rs` - Core mixer output routing
- `src-tauri/src/audio/devices/coreaudio_stream.rs` - Core Audio output streams
- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/audio_processing.rs` - Audio processing pipeline
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mixer.rs` - Mixer command handlers

**Next Steps**:

1. **Test Audio Path**: Verify audio flows from input → processing → output stages
2. **Check Output Streams**: Ensure output audio streams are properly initialized and connected
3. **Debug Master Output**: Verify master mixer output is feeding to audio output devices
4. **Review Modularization**: Check if output-related code was moved/broken during refactor
5. **Test Output Device Selection**: Ensure proper output device routing
6. **Validate Audio Callbacks**: Confirm output audio callbacks are being triggered

**Workaround**: None - core functionality is broken

**Impact**: Critical - Users cannot hear any audio output, making the application unusable for its primary purpose.

**Testing Strategy**:
- Add debug logging to audio output pipeline
- Test with different output devices (speakers, headphones, virtual outputs)  
- Verify audio data reaches final output stage
- Test mixer output levels and routing
