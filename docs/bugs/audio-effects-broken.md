## Audio Effects UI Completely Broken - Shows "No effects added"

**Status**: UNRESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-29

**Description**: The audio effects system is completely broken in the UI. When
users attempt to add effects (EQ, compressor, limiter) to a channel, the
interface only displays a tile saying "No effects added" instead of showing the
actual effect controls.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Start the application with `pnpm tauri dev`
2. Create a mixer and add a channel
3. Attempt to add an audio effect (EQ, compressor, limiter) to the channel
4. Expected: Effect control interface should appear with sliders/knobs for
   parameters
5. Actual: Only shows a tile with "No effects added" message

**Investigation Done**:

- Effects addition appears to trigger in the UI (button clicks register)
- No error messages are displayed to the user
- Effects controls do not render properly
- Issue likely introduced during the modularization of audio effects modules

**Root Cause Analysis**:

During the modularization refactor, the effects system was likely broken in one
of these areas:

1. **Effects Chain Integration**: The connection between UI and audio effects
   processing may be severed
2. **Component Rendering**: React components for effects may not be properly
   importing or rendering
3. **State Management**: Effects state may not be properly synchronized between
   frontend and backend
4. **API Communication**: Tauri commands for effects may be broken or
   misconfigured
5. **Effects Processing**: Backend effects processing may not be properly
   integrated with modular architecture

**Next Steps**:

1. **Check React Components**: Verify effects-related React components are
   properly imported and functional
2. **Test Tauri Commands**: Verify effects-related Tauri commands are working
   (`update_channel_eq`, `update_channel_compressor`, etc.)
3. **Debug State Management**: Check if effects state is properly maintained in
   both frontend and backend
4. **Verify Effects Chain**: Ensure `AudioEffectsChain` is properly integrated
   with modularized mixer
5. **Test Audio Processing**: Verify that effects are actually being applied to
   audio (even if UI is broken)

**Files to Investigate**:

- Frontend effects components in `src/components/` (React components)
- `src/commands/audio_effects.rs` (Tauri commands for effects)
- `src/audio/effects/mod.rs` (effects processing backend)
- `src/audio/mixer/transformer.rs` (effects integration with audio streams)
- Frontend effects state management and API calls

**Workaround**: None available - users cannot apply any audio effects to their
channels.

**Impact**: Professional audio processing features completely unavailable,
significantly reducing application functionality for DJ/streaming use cases.
