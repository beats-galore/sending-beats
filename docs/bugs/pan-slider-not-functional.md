## Pan Slider Not Functional

**Status**: UNRESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-30

**Description**: The pan slider in each channel strip of the Virtual Mixer does not affect the audio output. Moving the pan slider left or right has no audible effect on the stereo positioning of the audio signal, and the audio remains centered regardless of slider position.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Open the Virtual Mixer interface
2. Add an audio input channel with stereo audio source
3. Start the mixer and play audio through the channel
4. Move the pan slider from center to full left or full right
5. Expected: Audio should move to the left or right speaker accordingly
6. Actual: Audio remains centered in both speakers regardless of pan position

**Investigation Done**:

- UI slider updates correctly and reflects user input
- Pan control is present in channel strip interface
- Audio processing pipeline is functional for other effects (EQ, compressor)

**Next Steps**:

- Investigate pan implementation in channel audio processing pipeline
- Check if pan values are being passed from UI to backend correctly
- Examine `update_mixer_channel` command in `src-tauri/src/commands/mixer.rs:88`
- Verify pan processing in the audio effects chain in `src-tauri/src/audio/effects/`
- Check if stereo channel separation is implemented in the mixer core
- Test with mono vs stereo input sources to understand pan behavior

**Workaround** (if any): No current workaround - pan functionality is completely non-functional
