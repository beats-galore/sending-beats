## Recording Shows No Disk Space Available Despite Sufficient Storage

**Status**: UNRESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Discovered**: 2025-08-29

**Description**: The recording pane incorrectly displays that no disk space is
available, preventing users from recording audio. This appears to be a false
positive as the system has adequate storage space available.

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Start the application with `pnpm tauri dev`
2. Navigate to the Recording pane/tab
3. Attempt to start a recording or check recording status
4. Expected: Recording should be available with accurate disk space information
5. Actual: Interface shows "no disk space available" message

**Investigation Done**:

- System has sufficient disk space (verified independently)
- Issue likely introduced during modularization of recording-related modules
- May be related to file system access or disk space calculation logic

**Root Cause Analysis**:

During the modularization refactor, the disk space checking functionality was
likely broken in one of these areas:

1. **File System Access**: Recording service may not have proper access to query
   disk space
2. **Path Resolution**: Recording directory path may not be properly resolved or
   accessible
3. **Disk Space Calculation**: The logic for calculating available disk space
   may be faulty
4. **Permission Issues**: File system permissions may have been affected during
   refactor
5. **API Changes**: Recording service API calls may have been broken during
   modularization

**Next Steps**:

1. **Verify Disk Space API**: Check if `std::fs` or system calls for disk space
   are working
2. **Test Recording Directory**: Verify the recording directory path is valid
   and accessible
3. **Debug Recording Service**: Add logging to recording service initialization
   and disk space checks
4. **Check File Permissions**: Verify the application has proper file system
   permissions
5. **Test Recording Path Selection**: Ensure directory selection dialog works
   properly

**Files to Investigate**:

- `src/audio/recording/service.rs` (recording service and disk space logic)
- `src/commands/recording.rs` (recording commands and file system access)
- `src/audio/recording/types.rs` (recording configuration and path handling)

**Workaround**: Users cannot record audio until this is fixed. No manual
workaround available.

**Impact**: Recording functionality completely unavailable, preventing users
from capturing their mixes.
