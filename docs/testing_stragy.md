1. Monitor browser console during testing
2. Try invalid device combinations
3. Switch devices rapidly (stress test)
4. Force audio errors (sample rate mismatches)

✅ Expected Results:

- "🔧 Device error reported" messages in console
- Graceful failure handling (no crashes)
- Error recovery attempts logged

📈 Audio Statistics & Metrics Tests

Test 6: Real-Time Audio Statistics

Goal: Verify statistics bridge implementation

Steps:

1. Navigate to Master Section of mixer
2. Locate "Audio Metrics" panel
3. Start audio playback through mixer
4. Monitor metrics updates in real-time

✅ Expected Results:

- CPU Usage: Updates in real-time (1-5% typical)
- Sample Rate: Shows correct rate (44.1kHz/48kHz)
- Latency: Displays in milliseconds (<50ms good)
- Active Channels: Count updates as channels added/removed
- Buffer Stats: Underruns/overruns remain at 0 during normal use

Test 7: VU Meter Data Pipeline

Goal: Test optimized polling and data flow

Steps:

1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Start mixer with active audio
3. Monitor network requests for 30 seconds
4. Check console for VU data debug logs

✅ Expected Results:

- 📊 VU Data logs appear when audio is active
- Throttled updates at ~30fps (33ms intervals)
- Batch API calls (getChannelLevels, getMasterLevels, getMixerMetrics)
- No excessive polling when audio is silent

🔐 Security & Configuration Tests

Test 8: Secure Password Configuration

Goal: Verify hardcoded passwords removed

Steps:

1. Check streaming service initialization:

# Set environment variable

export ICECAST_PASSWORD="MySecurePassword123" 2. Restart the app with
environment variable set 3. Navigate to streaming configuration 4. Attempt to
initialize Icecast streaming

✅ Expected Results:

- No "hackme" passwords visible in UI or logs
- Environment variable used when available
- Fallback to "changeme" when env var not set
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

🎹 Professional DJ Features Tests (Partial)

Test 9: Advanced Mixer Controls

Goal: Test EQ, compressor, limiter functionality

Steps:

1. Add channel with active audio input
2. Adjust 3-band EQ (Low, Mid, High knobs)
3. Enable compressor → Adjust threshold, ratio, attack, release
4. Enable limiter → Set threshold
5. Listen for audio changes

✅ Expected Results:

- Real-time audio processing (hear EQ changes immediately)
- Professional audio quality (no artifacts or distortion)
- Parameter updates reflected in UI and audio output
- Effects chain working: Input → EQ → Compressor → Limiter → Output

⚠️ Stress Testing & Edge Cases

Test 10: Performance Under Load

Goal: Test system stability under stress

Steps:

1. Add maximum channels (5-6 channels)
2. Enable all effects on each channel
3. Play audio through all channels simultaneously
4. Rapid parameter changes (move all sliders quickly)
5. Run for 10+ minutes continuously

✅ Expected Results:

- No memory leaks (check browser memory tab)
- Stable performance throughout test
- No audio dropouts or buffer underruns
- VU meters remain responsive under load
- CPU usage stays reasonable (<15%)

Test 11: Device Switching Stress Test

Goal: Test rapid device changes

Steps:

1. Start with working mixer
2. Rapidly switch input devices 5-10 times
3. Rapidly switch output devices 5-10 times
