## Lock-Free SPSC Audio Buffer Refactor

**Status**: IN PROGRESS (Command Architecture Phase)  
**Priority**: High  
**Date Identified**: 2025-09-04  
**Updated**: 2025-09-04 (Command Channel Architecture Strategy)

**Description**: Replace `tokio::sync::Mutex<VecDeque<f32>>` audio buffers with lock-free Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) queues to eliminate timing drift caused by lock contention micro-delays that accumulate over thousands of audio processing cycles.

**Current Issues**:

- Lock acquisition delays (even 50-100μs) accumulate into significant timing drift (1.31ms observed)
- Audio crackle caused by occasional lock contention between audio input callbacks and mixer thread
- `tokio::sync::Mutex` adds unnecessary overhead for single producer/consumer scenario
- Lock contention diagnostics show timing variations that compound over time
- Current architecture has no theoretical guarantee of contention-free operation

## 🚨 **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY: Send+Sync Issues**

**Issue Discovered During Implementation**: RTRB Producer/Consumer types don't implement `Send + Sync` due to internal `*mut f32` pointers and `Cell<usize>` usage. This breaks Rust's thread safety requirements when trying to share `Arc<AudioInputStream>` across threads via Tauri commands.

**Root Cause**: RTRB is designed for true single-producer single-consumer scenarios where each Producer/Consumer is owned by exactly one thread, not shared via Arc between threads.

**Critical Insight**: The lock-free audio callbacks **ARE WORKING CORRECTLY** - the issue is in the **management layer** that tries to share AudioInputStream across Tauri command threads.

## 🎯 **NEW STRATEGY: Command Channel Architecture**

**Solution**: Completely isolate the audio thread and use **message passing** instead of shared memory.

### **Architecture Overview**:

```rust
┌─────────────────┐    Commands     ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Tauri UI      │ ──────────────► │  Isolated Audio Thread │
│   Commands      │                 │                         │
│                 │ ◄────────────── │  • Owns AudioInputStream│
│                 │   Responses     │  • Lock-free RTRB       │
└─────────────────┘                 │  • No Arc sharing       │
                                    └─────────────────────────┘
```

### **Implementation Strategy**:

**Phase 1: Command Infrastructure** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Command channel (`mpsc::Sender<AudioCommand>`) added to AudioState
- ✅ IsolatedAudioManager owns AudioInputStream directly (no Arc)
- ✅ Tauri commands use message passing instead of Arc<AudioInputStream>

**Phase 2: Remove Arc Sharing** (IN PROGRESS)
- 🔄 Remove all Arc<AudioInputStream> references from VirtualMixer
- 🔄 Update remaining Tauri commands to use command channel
- 🔄 Stub out UI data responses (VU meters) for now

**Phase 3: Audio Pipeline Validation**
- ⏳ Test lock-free audio: Input → RTRB → Mixer → SPMC → Output
- ⏳ Verify timing drift elimination 
- ⏳ Confirm audio is audible through speakers

**Phase 4: Bidirectional Communication** (FUTURE)
- ⏳ Implement VU meter data flow back to UI
- ⏳ Add real-time metrics and status updates

**Proposed Solution** (Updated with Command Architecture):

**Multi-Stage Lock-Free Pipeline Architecture**:

**Stage 1: Input Buffers (Multiple RTRB SPSC Queues)**
- Each input device/channel gets its own dedicated `rtrb::RingBuffer` 
- Single Producer per queue: Audio input callback thread (CPAL) for that device
- Single Consumer per queue: Mixer processing thread
- Benefits: Wait-free real-time operations, ~100-120ns latency, device isolation

**Stage 2: Mixed Output Queue (spmcq SPMC Queue)**  
- After mixer synchronizes inputs and applies gain/effects
- Single Producer: Mixer processing thread (after combining all inputs)
- Multiple Consumers: Recording service + Icecast streaming service + Core audio output  
- Benefits: Different consumer priorities, dropout detection, skip-ahead for lagging consumers

**Benefits**:
- Zero lock acquisition timing variations
- Complete isolation between input devices  
- Clean separation of mixed audio distribution
- Maintains exact same API surface for minimal disruption
- Enables independent consumer processing rates

**Files Affected**:

**Stage 1: Input Buffer Replacement**
- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/stream_management.rs` - Replace AudioInputStream buffer with per-device SPSC queue
- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/types.rs` - Update VirtualMixer to track multiple input queues
- `src-tauri/src/audio/devices/cpal_integration.rs` - Update audio callback to push to device-specific SPSC queue

**Stage 2: Mixed Output Pipeline**
- `src-tauri/src/audio/mixer/mixer_core.rs` - Add mixed output queue after synchronization/effects
- `src-tauri/src/audio/recording/` - Update recording service to consume from mixed output queue
- `src-tauri/src/audio/streaming/icecast.rs` - Update streaming service to consume from mixed output queue
- `src-tauri/src/audio/devices/coreaudio_stream.rs` - Update core audio output to consume from mixed output queue

**Dependencies**
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Add `rtrb` for SPSC input queues and `spmcq` for SPMC output distribution

   - 🔄 Remove `Arc<AudioInputStream>` references from StreamingService  
   - 🔄 Update all Tauri commands to use command channel pattern
   - 🔄 Stub out commands that need bidirectional data (VU meters, metrics)
   - 🔄 Fix Send+Sync compilation errors

4. **Lock-Free Audio Callbacks** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ AudioInputStream uses owned `Producer<f32>` and `Consumer<f32>` (no Arc/Mutex)
   - ✅ Audio callbacks use direct `producer.push()` calls (lock-free)
   - ✅ Mixer uses direct `consumer.pop()` calls (lock-free)
   - ✅ SPMC output queues for lock-free output distribution

5. **Audio Pipeline Validation** (NEXT PRIORITY)
   - ⏳ Test complete pipeline: Input Device → RTRB → IsolatedAudioManager → SPMC → Output Device
   - ⏳ Verify audio is audible through configured output device
   - ⏳ Measure timing drift elimination (target: <0.1ms over 10 minutes)
   - ⏳ Confirm lock-free operation under load

6. **Bidirectional Communication** (FUTURE)
   - ⏳ Implement VU meter data flow from isolated thread back to UI
   - ⏳ Add real-time metrics collection and reporting
   - ⏳ Restore full UI functionality with new architecture

**Testing Strategy**:

- **Timing Drift Test**: Run for 10+ minutes, measure drift accumulation vs current implementation
- **Audio Quality Test**: A/B test processed audio output for artifacts or differences  
- **Load Testing**: Test with multiple simultaneous input streams under CPU load
- **Buffer Behavior**: Test queue full/empty edge cases
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure CPU usage and latency improvements
- **Cross-Platform**: Verify operation on different operating systems

**Breaking Changes**: 

- None - maintaining identical public API surface
- Internal buffer implementation is completely hidden from external callers
- Existing audio processing logic unchanged

**Estimated Effort** (Updated): 

- **Research Phase**: 4 hours ✅ **COMPLETED** (RTRB + spmcq selected)
- **Command Architecture**: 4 hours ✅ **COMPLETED** (Message passing infrastructure)  
- **Arc Removal**: 4-6 hours 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (Fix Send+Sync compilation errors)
- **Audio Pipeline Testing**: 2-4 hours ⏳ **NEXT** (End-to-end audio validation)
- **Bidirectional Communication**: 4-6 hours ⏳ **FUTURE** (VU meters, metrics)
- **Total**: 18-24 hours over 4-5 sessions

**Current Progress**: ~50% complete (architecture and lock-free queues done, compilation fixes in progress)

**Key Technical Considerations**:

**Input Stage (RTRB SPSC Queues)**:
- **Queue Capacity**: 4096-8192 samples per device (matches typical audio buffer sizes)
- **Real-time Guarantees**: Wait-free operations, no blocking in audio callbacks
- **Device Isolation**: Complete independence, each device has dedicated producer/consumer pair
- **Timing Synchronization**: Mixer handles different fill rates with bulk `pop_slice()` operations

**Output Stage (spmcq SPMC Queue)**:
- **Consumer Priorities**: High-priority audio output, medium-priority streaming, low-priority recording
- **Dropout Handling**: `ReadResult::Dropout(_)` when consumer falls behind, can skip ahead
- **Rate Independence**: Each consumer reads at own pace, producer never blocks
- **Memory Efficiency**: Single copy of mixed audio, multiple lightweight readers
- **Error Recovery**: `reader.skip_ahead()` allows lagging consumers to catch up gracefully

**General**:
- **Memory Ordering**: Ensure proper atomic operations for cross-thread safety
- **Sample Drop Policy**: Define behavior when producer outpaces consumer (current: drop oldest samples)
- **Performance Characteristics**: RTRB provides O(1) operations, spmcq optimized for audio workloads  
- **Error Handling**: RTRB handles overflow by dropping samples, spmcq provides dropout detection
- **Buffer Alignment**: Both libraries optimized for audio with proper memory alignment
- **Consumer Starvation**: spmcq prevents slow consumers from blocking the producer
- **Data Types**: Both libraries work with `Copy` types (perfect for `f32` audio samples)

**Success Metrics**:

- Timing drift reduced to near-zero (< 0.1ms over 10 minutes)
- Audio crackle elimination  
- CPU usage reduction in audio processing thread
- Maintained audio quality and all existing functionality

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES**

**Current Focus**: Get the lock-free audio pipeline **audible** - UI polish comes later.
