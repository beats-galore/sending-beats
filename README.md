# Sendin Beats - Professional Radio Streaming Platform

A comprehensive, cross-platform radio streaming application designed to replace
and enhance tools like Ladiocast/Loopback and radio.co. Built with Tauri (Rust
backend) + React TypeScript frontend.

## üéØ Project Vision

Sendin Beats is a multi-phased radio streaming platform providing an all-in-one
solution for professional DJs and radio stations, featuring virtual audio
mixing, Icecast streaming, and broadcast automation.

rubato = "0.15"            # Sample rate conversion
dasp = "0.11"              # Digital signal processing
fundsp = "0.16"            # Real-time audio effects

# Platform-specific Integration
coreaudio-rs = "0.11"      # macOS Core Audio
windows = { features = ["Win32_Media_Audio"] }  # WASAPI
alsa = "0.7"               # Linux ALSA
pulse = "2.28"             # PulseAudio
```
